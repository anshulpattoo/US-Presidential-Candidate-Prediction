# US-Presidential-Candidate-Prediction
The primary question our analytics attempts to answer is this: What kind of pattern in the language of a speech
predicts whether a US presidential candidate will win or lose an election? There are three specific goals we address while answering
this question. Our goals are:

1. To make the most accurate prediction of the likelihood of winning a US presidential election based on the
words used in speeches.
  
2. To find some of the words that might be associated with winning speeches, and to see if they collectively
suggest any strategies for good speeches.

3. To see if deceptive language has any role in winning US presidential elections.
